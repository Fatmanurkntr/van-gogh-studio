> **"I dream my painting and I paint my dream."** — Vincent van Gogh

**Van Gogh Studio** is an immersive creative coding experiment that deconstructs masterpieces into thousands of living, breathing particles. Built with raw **HTML5 Canvas** and physics simulations, it features audio reactivity, mobile touch support, and deep integration with **Google Gemini AI**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Interactive Physics Engine
* **Flow Fields:** The painting behaves like a fluid. Use your mouse or finger to disrupt the stars or paint new wind directions.
* **Touch Support:** Fully optimized for mobile devices. Interact with the artwork using multi-touch gestures.
* **Deep Zoom:** A multi-layered rendering system creates a 3D-like depth effect.

### 🤖 Powered by Gemini AI
* **Art Critic:** Uses **Gemini Vision** to analyze the current canvas state and provide poetic feedback.
* **Generative Painting:** Describe a concept (e.g., "Cyberpunk Forest"), and the AI generates a raw SVG that instantly transforms into particles.
* **Prompt Magic:** Enhances simple keywords into detailed artistic prompts.

### 🎵 Audio Reactivity
* **Live Visualizer:** The particles dance to your music via microphone input.
* **Frequency Response:** Bass frequencies expand particle size, while treble impacts movement chaos.

### 🛠️ Creative Tools
* **Neon Mode:** Switch to a cyberpunk aesthetic with glowing particles.
* **Color Studio:** Apply smart color filters (e.g., typing "Fire" changes the palette to reds/oranges).
* **Video Recording:** Native support to record **HQ WebM** videos of your creation.
* **Auto Pilot:** A "Van Gogh Mode" that simulates the famous swirling motion automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project is built as a **Single File Application** for maximum portability. No heavy `node_modules` or build steps required.

### 🌐 Live Demo
[**Click here to view the project live**](https://fatmanurkntr.github.io/van-gogh-studio/)

### 💻 Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Fatmanurkntr/van-gogh-studio.git](https://github.com/Fatmanurkntr/van-gogh-studio.git)
    ```

2.  **Open the file**
    * It is highly recommended to use a local server (like VS Code "Live Server") to avoid browser CORS restrictions with images.
    * Open `index.html` in your browser.
